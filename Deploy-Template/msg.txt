Reedemer called Andre regarding the R Haddock site, and to find out what he is currently using to host sites on.
Andre explained that they use a Linux server.
Reedemer explained that we cannot run the R Haddock next.js app on a linux server, so Andre suggested we send him the IP address of where we will be hosting, 
and he will simply point rhaddock.co.za to that new address.
Thus allowing us to host the new site on AWS Amplify.
